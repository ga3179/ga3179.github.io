		<h2>Food for Thought</h2>
		<img src="images/nutrition1.jpg" alt="food for thought image" class="desktop">
		<p>Good nutrition is a lifestyle, not a diet. It starts with a new way of thinking about food. Think of your body as a vehicle that uses food for fuel. Fill your tank with the right type of fuel.</p>
		<p>Do not approach your nutrition plan as a diet plan, but rather, a lifestyle change. If you make a permanent change, you will see big results. They key to success is a daily focus on your goal.</p>
		<p>Portion your meals and track your calories. There are many free mobile apps available to help track your activity level and calories.</p>
		<p>Control impulsive urges to buy junk food, and instead, allow yourself to one "cheat" meal a week.</p>
